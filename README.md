## Hi! ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ’¬ My interests are:
Cloud native automation, using Kubernetes, Argo toolchain, in a gitops way (using Argo CD).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  How to become a better contributor, as doing pull requests feels like a pain

- âš¡ Fun fact:
I once gave a lightnign talk on KRM and Argo CD, here is the repo: https://github.com/nokia/argocd-krm-plugin-examples, and a link to the youtube recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNHIbiRMS78&list=PLj6h78yzYM2MqzIJyc5OBXAgFxjW6ZyBq
